# smart_water_tank
It is always a difficult task to monitor the water tank is empty or not. If tank gets empty then we have to pump water and then again we have to monitor the tank until it gets fill up and sometimes there may be a wastage of water if pump was turned off late. Nowadays efficient water use is very important but we may not have an idea of our daily water usage.

# Outcomes
1. Our system ensures that No overflow takes place from the tank which means no
wastage of water.
2. Our smart water tank solution automatically monitors the water level in the
tank and provides real-time updates with the help of incorporated sensors.
3. Provides daily water usage data
4. provides water bill for individual household
