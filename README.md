# smart_water_tank
It is always a difficult task to monitor the water tank is empty or not. If tank gets empty then we have to pump water and then again we have to monitor the tank until it gets fill up and sometimes there may be a wastage of water if pump was turned off late. Nowadays efficient water use is very important but we may not have an idea of our daily water usage.
